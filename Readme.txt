Folder Overview:
Inside this folder, you'll find the R code needed to recreate the research study titled "Regional Industrial Effects in Germany from a Potential Gas Deficit" conducted by Robert Lehmann and Christoph Schult.

How to Execute:
To replicate the study's findings, simply run the "Main.R" script. It takes care of running all the necessary scripts located in the "Scripts" folder.

Functions:

    functionsioanalysis.R: This file houses two important R functions:
        compiocoeff: Calculates sector-specific domestic inputs and input coefficient matrices, essential for further input-output (IO) analysis.
        computelink: Performs calculations to simulate how changes in production and imports impact economic output across various sectors and regions.

Scripts:

    Script1_SimulateGasStorage.R: Generates a gas consumption profile and computes gas shortages based on data from an Excel file.
    Script2a_CreateIOReducedBL.R and Script2b_CreateIOReducedEastWest.R: Create regional input-output (IO) matrices, crucial for analyzing economic interdependencies among sectors and regions. They process raw data, map it based on predefined classifications, and save it in Excel format.
    Script3a_Computation.R: Uses input-output (IO) analysis to calculate first and second-round effects across different sectors, saving results as matrices in RDS and Excel files.
    Script3b_ComputationActual.R: Processes various data sources, including sector-specific gas shares and regional economic data, using custom functions (compiocoeff and computelink) for specific IO calculations. It also compares simulation results with actual data.
    Script4a_FirstSecondRoundEffects.R: Focuses on evaluating the impact of gas shortages across different rounds and regions using both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Detailed results, including state-specific losses, are saved in Excel format.
    Script4b_IntermediateImports.R: Calculates additional demand for intermediate goods for each month and interval with a gas shortage, separately for bottom-up and top-down approaches. Results are saved in Excel files.
    Script5_SimpleExample.R: Demonstrates IO analysis to compute first and second-round effects for an online appendix illustration.
